# skinMatch

Choosing the right skincare products today can feel overwhelming. With thousands of products on the market, each promising different results, it can be difficult for users, especially those new to skincare, to find products that truly meet their unique needs. Many people struggle to understand which ingredients match their skin type, how to avoid harmful components, or how to build an effective routine without spending hours researching.

SkinMatch was created to simplify this experience. It is a personalized skincare recommendation platform designed to make product discovery easier, smarter, and more user-centered.
By combining a tailored skincare quiz, ingredient-based filtering, and a centralized community review system, SkinMatch helps users confidently find products that align with their skin type, concerns, allergies, and budget.

The platform is fully responsive across desktop and mobile devices, supporting seamless browsing no matter how users access it. Built with Java (Spring Boot), SQL, REST APIs, Appsmith, and Docker, SkinMatch emphasizes scalability, security, and a smooth user experience.

Looking ahead, there are plans to incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning to further refine the recommendation algorithm â€” making skincare even more personalized and predictive based on evolving user trends. The goal is to continue innovating to make skincare accessible, science-driven, and genuinely helpful for every user.
